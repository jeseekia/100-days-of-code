# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2021

### Day 1: February 5, 2021
##### HTML & CSS

**Today's Progress**: I covered Basic HTML and half of the Basic CSS (up to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/understand-absolute-versus-relative-units) on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum

**Thoughts:** The refresher was pretty straightforward as I expected. I did use an attribute selector for what I think is the first time.

### Day 2: February 6, 2021
##### CSS & DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I finished Basic CSS and got into Visual Design (up to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/adjust-the-hover-state-of-an-anchor-tag) on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. HTML outline of DetroitIpsum.

**Thoughts:** I'm still in review territory for the most part, but I got to explain a lot on [stream](http://twitch.tv/metadevgirl). Also variables in CSS: I'm late to the party, but I love it! And I am finally getting DetroitIpsum back up and running. Today I cleaned up the old project and made the skeleton for the site.

### Day 3: February 7, 2021
##### CSS & DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I got to cover some CSS positioning and animations (up to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/make-motion-more-natural-using-a-bezier-curve) on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I feel good about positioning now that I refreshed my memory. CSS graphics and animations are still a bit foreign to me, but I said I would pick at least a few small projects on those specifically. I do need to make [stream](http://twitch.tv/metadevgirl) effects so I should be able to brainstorm about ideas. I got the basic layout finished for Detroit Ipsum and it was pretty painless so that felt good. I started taking a few notes on Notion and I think I'm going to double down on that.

### Day 4: February 8, 2021
##### DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I did some spacing for the main sections and got a lot of the styling done for the header.

**Thoughts:** I started a new job today (vs being off the first few days of the challenge) so I was kind of tired, but I am glad I made some progress. I didn't get done like I originally planned. That's ok. I'll keep working tomorrow!

### Day 5: February 9, 2021
##### DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I did minor work on the header.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time researching and trying to understand some of my options. I think I need to get a timer and start timeboxing things.

### Day 6: February 10, 2021
##### DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I did minor work on the nav.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time researching as well today, but it was very productive time spent. I learned about collapsing margins. I also had some interesting conversation about styling "layout" elements vs "content" elements. I want to go through my [streams](http://twitch.tv/metadevgirl) from this week and clip some of the solved problems and philosophical considerations that I went through so far. (Whether I'll actually take the time to do that is another story. I should probably add a stream marker button to my Stream Deck.) I'm glad I started back at the beginning for this process because I'm getting to dive a layer deeper this time around and learn more about some of the inner workings of different tags and properties rather than just build something that works.

### Day 7: February 11, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp Accessibility and Responsiveness

**Today's Progress**: I covered all of the Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I decided to focus on learning today to finish off some more of the material I want to cover. I am surprised how informative the accessibility section was. In my past learning experiences the material was glossed over. The FCC lessons packed a lot of good info into a pretty short module. I have a lot to apply to my current project and it gives me more elements to consider as I design future layouts.

### Day 8: February 12, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp Flexbox and DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I covered all of the Flexbox material in FreeCodeCamp. I also refactored my nav and footer layout for DetroitIpsum.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox was pretty straightforward for me to use. I want to learn about some of the quirks of using width and height with the flex properties as I go. It was simple to refactor my layout.

### Day 9: February 13, 2021
##### Flexbox Froggy and DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I covered all of the [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). I also refactored my nav and footer layout for DetroitIpsum.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have any issues implementing Flexbox into my project. I did find myself wondering if I was abusing it haha. I would like to have someone do a code review of what I landed on. I pretty much finished up the main layout of DetroitIpsum so I merged my working branch.

### Day 10: February 14, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp CSS Grid, CSS Grid Garden and prep Frieza tribute project

**Today's Progress**: I covered all of the CSS Grid material on FreeCodeCamp. I practiced by finishing [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com). I also setup my repo to get started on my tribute site for the first FCC project.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid is pretty dense material, but for the most part everything I covered made sense for me. I liked learning about using the fr unit. I want to get more practice with that. Grid Garden actually helped a bit with practicing some more complicated options for specifying and selecting areas in your grid. I really liked how named grid-template-areas, grid-area, and media queries can be combined for responsive design. I'm looking forward to implementing that in some future projects. I'm done with the material for the Responsive Web Design Certification. I have 5 FCC projects to build before I move on to either JS or DS&A.
