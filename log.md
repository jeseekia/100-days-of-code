# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 5, 2021
##### HTML & CSS

**Today's Progress**: I covered Basic HTML and half of the Basic CSS (up to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/understand-absolute-versus-relative-units) on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum

**Thoughts:** The refresher was pretty straightforward as I expected. I did use an attribute selector for what I think is the first time.

### Day 2: February 6, 2021
##### CSS & DetroitIpsum

**Today's Progress**: I finished Basic CSS and got into Visual Design (up to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/adjust-the-hover-state-of-an-anchor-tag) on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I'm still in review territory for the most part, but I got to explain a lot on [stream](http://twitch.tv/metadevgirl). Also variables in CSS: I'm late to the party, but I love it! And I am finally getting DetroitIpsum back up and running. Today I cleaned up the old project and made the skeleton for the site.
