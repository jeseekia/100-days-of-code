# 100 Days Of Code / ML && 100 Days of Content - Log 2023

## Learning Objectives / Goals
This is my 4th or 5th attempt at this challenge since I originally began learning to code. I am coding and livestreaming my journey as a part of the challenge so livestreaming is just as important to me as completing my daily material.

My planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

* Improve Python expertise
* Contribute to Open Source ML library / model / project
* Notion AI/ML Hub
* Improve in Machine Learning
* Learn Deep Learning
* Focus on NLP
* Implement a research paper
* Encourage others yayy!!


### Day 1: May 8, 2023
##### Goals, ML/AI Course selection

**Today's Progress**:
I decided on my planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

**Thoughts:** 
I feel good about the materials I've chosen for my learning path and plan to provide some of the resources I've found for others that are interested in DL.

### Day 2: May 9, 2023
##### Kaggle setup, intro to image recognition with fast.ai

**Today's Progress**:
I watched the beginning of the Lesson 1 video and set up my Kaggle notebooks.

**Thoughts:** 
Lesson 1 covered the idea of using image recognition models for other types of data, now I'm super curious about experimenting with other types of data like sound. My first impressions on the course are all positive. I appreciate that there is a focus on top-down learning and using multiple resources to learn the same information was also mentioned. In addition to the video and text materials, I will be following the corresponding book [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).

### Day 3: May 10, 2023
##### Start image recognition project with Kaggle notebook

**Today's Progress**:
I finished the video lesson, set up my Python env and got a local Jupyter server running.

**Thoughts:** 
Since I finished lesson 1 yesterday, I want to begin working through the book and get started on an image classification project.

### Day 4: May 11, 2023
##### FastBook Chapter 1

**Today's Progress**:
I started reading Lesson 1 from [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)

**Thoughts:** 
I have set up my python environment and Jupyter local server so I will work through the book materials for chapter 1 including any exercises that come up. If I finish the projects without working on the image classification example, I will do that as a follow up project. I also like that I saw a long list of Quiz questions at the end of the book. That gives me more to study from.

### Day 5: May 12, 2023
##### FastBook Chapter 1 cont...

**Today's Progress**:
I read more of Lesson 1 about the history of Deep Learning. There are some foundational essays, papers, and books that I am taking note of to look into for later study.

**Thoughts:** 
So far I have been refreshing on the history of Deep Learning and neural networks. It is helpful to understand how the field has evovled over time and pivotal moments that account for growth and advancement.

### Day 6: May 13, 2023
##### FastBook Chapter 1 cont...

**Today's Progress**:
I set up Google Colabs to run my [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) Lesson examples and connected them to a repo on Github.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I want to make sure I set up some cloud-based notebooks for my projects as I discovered yesterday, even the simple training is a lot with me livestreaming at the same time.

### Day 7: May 14, 2023
##### FastBook Chapter 1 cont...

**Today's Progress**:
I read more of the Lesson 1 material from [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook), but could not finish training my model example (image classifier) before the end of my coding session.

**Thoughts:** 
Yesterday, I got my notebooks running in Google Colabs. I have some other platforms I want to test out, but I've used Colabs for most of my projects recently and it works well to back them up to Github. Yesterday it took an hour for the image classifier example to train and I ended up leaving it to train after stream ended so as I work through the material today I'm going to start the training early and hopefully be able to work with the model during the streaming session.

### Day 8: May 15, 2023
##### Model deployment...

**Thoughts:** 
I am looking into model deployment with the intention of making training and engaging with my models easier alongside my studying. 

**Today's Progress**:
I finished reading more of the Lesson 1 material and got into the breakdown of the image classifier example. I decided to wait on deployment since it is literally Lesson 2 and just work through the Lesson 1 material to finish in the next few days. I also used one of my pomodoro breaks to add something new to the AI/ML Notion Hub that I'm building so I will try to make that a habit to help finish it by the end of the month.

### Day 9: May 16, 2023
##### Finishing chapter 1

**Thoughts:** 
As I finish up my chapter 1 reading, I am listening in on Senate hearings on AI Oversight. I would like to incorporate other news and industry updates as it is important to keep up with these items and talk about them within the developer community as well.

**Today's Progress**:
I finished watching the hearing and I was able to read through the image classification example explaination and recap it aftwards just to make sure I digested while I was multi-tasking.

### Day 10: May 17, 2023
##### Finishing chapter 1

**Thoughts:** 
As I finish up my chapter 1 reading, I am listening in on House hearings on Generative AI and Copyright Law. AI News Playlist already has another video added! 

**Today's Progress**:
I finished watching the House hearings and didn't finish a lot of reading, but I learned about examples of applying image classification to other datasets.

### Day 11: May 18, 2023
##### Finishing chapter 1

**Thoughts:** 
Today I'm proud of the progress I've made so far. As I go into another 10 day round, I would like to improve my pacing a little bit on finishing the reading materials. My goal is to finish chapter 1 today.

**Today's Progress**:
I got to see some other common DL examples including Object Detection, Sentiment Analysis, and a Recommendation System through the reading.

- Object Detection
- Recommendation System

"Mini-project
- Image Classifier

"Project"
- Sentiment Analysis

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 13: May 20, 2023
##### Starting Lesson 2

**Thoughts:** 
I'm going to focus on deployment and looking forward to trying some newer ML tools that I've been eyeing for a minute.

**Today's Progress**:
I was able to finish most of the lesson 2 video and got a model deployed and running through Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio.

### Day 14: May 21, 2023
##### Lesson 2 Video and starting Chapter 2 of the fast.ai book

**Thoughts:** 
I feel pretty accomplished to have an understanding of model deployment with Hugging Face and Gradio and feel more empowered to work on exercises and projects now.
