# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 5, 2021
##### HTML & CSS

**Today's Progress**: I covered Basic HTML and half of the Basic CSS (up to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/understand-absolute-versus-relative-units) on FreeCodeCamp's curriculum

**Thoughts:** The refresher was pretty straightforward as I expected. I did use an attribute selector for what I think is the first time.
