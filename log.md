# 100 Days Of Code / ML && 100 Days of Content - Log 2023

### Day 1: May 8, 2023
##### Goals, ML/AI Course selection

**Today's Progress**:

My planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

**Thoughts:** 
I feel good about the materials I've chosen for my learning path and plan to provide some of the resources I've found for others that are interested in DL.

### Day 2: May 9, 2023
##### Kaggle setup, intro to image recognition with fast.ai

**Today's Progress**:

My planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

**Thoughts:** 
Lesson 1 covered the idea of using image recognition models for other types of data, now I'm super curious about experimenting with other types of data like sound. My first impressions on the course are all positive. I appreciate that there is a focus on top-down learning and using multiple resources to learn the same information was also mentioned. In addition to the video and text materials, I will be following the corresponding book [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).

### Day 3: May 10, 2023
##### Start image recognition project with Kaggle notebook

**Today's Progress**:

My planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

**Thoughts:** 
Since I finished lesson 1 yesterday, I want to begin working through the book and get started on an image classification project.

### Day 4: May 11, 2023
##### FastBook Chapter 1

**Today's Progress**:

My planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)

**Thoughts:** 
I have set up my python environment and Jupyter local server so I will work through the book materials for chapter 1 including any exercises that come up. If I finish the projects without working on the image classification example, I will do that as a follow up project. I also like that I saw a long list of Quiz questions at the end of the book. That gives me more to study from.

**Thoughts:** 
So far I have been refreshing on the history of Deep Learning and neural networks. It is helpful to understand how the field has evovled over time and pivotal moments that account for growth and advancement.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I want to make sure I set up some cloud-based notebooks for my projects as I discovered yesterday, even the simple training is a lot with me livestreaming at the same time.

**Thoughts:** 
Yesterday, I got my notebooks running in Google Colabs. I have some other platforms I want to test out, but I've used Colabs for most of my projects recently and it works well to back them up to Github. Yesterday it took an hour for the image classifier example to train and I ended up leaving it to train after stream ended so as I work through the material today I'm going to start the training early and hopefully be able to work with the model during the streaming session.
