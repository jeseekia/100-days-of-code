##### Python Curriculum and Reveal.JS Codebase

**Today's Progress**: I updated some Intro Python materials in RevealJS.

**Thoughts:** I've always known that keeping our Reveal materials up to date was tedious and took a lot of grunt work to do major cleanup. Now I'm really interested in applying some automation and SWE principles to the codebase. Having a tool check for deadlinks in slides for example - that would be nice!
