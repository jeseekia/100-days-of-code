##### Goals, ML/AI Course selection

**Today's Progress**:

My planned learning path:
[fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) -> [Hugging Face - NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) -> [DeepLearning.ai - NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)
